耶利米

===== Facts: =====

實情：

Jeremiah was a prophet of God in the kingdom of Judah.

耶利米是神在猶大王國裡的一個先知。

  * Like most of the prophets, Jeremiah often had to warn the people that God was going to punish them for their sins.
  * 像大多數先知一樣，耶利米過去也經常提醒眾民，神要刑罰他們的罪。
  * Jeremiah prophesied that the Babylonians would capture Jerusalem, which made some of the people of Judah angry. So they put him in a dry well and left him there die. But the king of Judah ordered his servants to rescue Jeremiah from the well.
  * 耶利米預言迦勒底人必佔領耶路撒冷的話，惹怒了許多猶大人。於是他們就把他關在一個乾井裡等死。但是猶大王卻派了他的幾個僕人把耶利米從井裡給救出來。

聖經故事裡的例子：

  * **[[:zh-tw:obs:notes:frames:19-17|[19-17]]]** Once, the prophet **Jeremiah**  was put into a dry well and left there to die. He sank down into the mud that was in the bottom of the well, but then the king had mercy on him and ordered his servants to pull **Jeremiah**  out of the well before he died.
  * 【19－17】從前，先知耶利米曾經被關在一個乾井裡等死。因為他是陷在井底裡的爛泥中，所以國王就憐憫他，並在他快死之前派遣他的幾個僕人去把耶利米從井裡給救出來。
  * **[[:zh-tw:obs:notes:frames:21-05|[21-05]]]** Through the prophet **Jeremiah**, God promised that he would make a New Covenant, but not like the covenant God made with Israel at Sinai.
  * 【21－05】透過耶利米先知，神應許要與他另立新約，但這約不像從前神在西乃山上與以色列所立的約。
