A young man named **Saul** agreed with the people who killed Stephen and **guarded their robes** while they threw stones at him. That day, many people in **Jerusalem** started **persecuting** the followers of Jesus, so the **believers** fled to other places. **But in spite of this**, they **preached** about Jesus everywhere they went.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **guarded their robes** - This could be translated as, "watched over their coats." He was probably making sure they didn't get stolen or damaged.
  * **But in spite of this** - The Jewish leaders thought they could stop the spread of Jesus' teaching by persecuting his followers. Instead, this caused them to scatter and spread the message even more widely.
