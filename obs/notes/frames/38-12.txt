**Jesus prayed** three times, “**My Father**, if it is possible, please let me not have to **drink this cup of suffering**. But if there is no other way for people’s **sins** to be **forgiven**, then **let your will be done**.” Jesus was very troubled and **his sweat was like drops of blood**. **God** sent an **angel** to strengthen him.
