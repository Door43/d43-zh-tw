===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **the promises â€¦ were passed on** - The promises of the covenant that God made with Abraham were not for him only, but also for his descendants.
  * **countless** - This could also be translated as, "very many." The word "countless" means there would be so many descendants that people would not be able to count them.
