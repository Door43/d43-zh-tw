===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **the Skull** - A hill near Jerusalem with a white, rocky top that was shaped somewhat like the top of a skull.
  * **forgive them, because they do not know what they are doing** - That is, "they do not understand the meaning of what they are doing, so please forgive them." The soldiers thought Jesus was only a criminal who deserved to die. They did not understand that he was the Son of God.
