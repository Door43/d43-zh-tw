Ten years after **Abram** and **Sarai** arrived in **Canaan**, **they still did not have a child**. So Abram's wife, Sarai, said to him, “Since **God** has not allowed me to have children and now I am too old to have children, here is my **servant**, **Hagar**. **Marry her also** so she can **have a child for me**.”

===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **still did not have a child** - Without a child, Abram had no descendants to become a great nation.
  * **Marry her also** - Abram would take Hagar as a second wife, but Hagar would not have the full status of a wife as Sarai did. She was still Sarai's servant.
  * **have a child for me** - Since Hagar was Sarai's servant, Sarai would be considered the mother of any children that Hagar bore.
