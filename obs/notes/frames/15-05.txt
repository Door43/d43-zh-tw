Then the walls around **Jericho** fell down! The **Israelites** destroyed everything in the city as **God** had commanded. They only spared **Rahab** and her family, who **became part of** the Israelites. When the other people living in **Canaan** heard that the Israelites had destroyed Jericho, they were terrified that the Israelites would attack them also.
