===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Did I not tell you?** - That is, "Remember that I told you." Jesus is not asking this question in order to get an answer, so some languages should translate this as a command.
  * **see God's glory** - That is, "see the glory of God displayed" or, "see God show how great he is."
  * **rolled the stone away** - Some languages should say, "rolled the stone away from the opening of the tomb."
